# Soccer-Streaming


This is the streaming server for the arena. Here is what you need 

-Janus
-Its dependencies

All this can be found here, follow this guide

https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway

Once you have installed janus go where there are .jcfg.sample files, they should be in a folder called janus. Mine was in /usr/local/etc/janus.

You must replace that folder with the one in this repository, once you have done that run janus and click on the html file.
